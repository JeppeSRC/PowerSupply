TODO for rev3:
	- Fan controller
*	- C_LIMIT and OUTPUT_ON LEDS to be driven by a nfet (2N7002NXAK) from VDD
	- Increase output capacitance
	- Increase current sense amplifier output capacitance
	- Increase input capacitance
	- Make more room between encoders
	- Push button for selecting boot loader during reset
	- Connect Iread and Vread to SDADC and ADC
	- C_LIMIT controlled by hardware?
	- Fix Vset error amplifier output
	- Add minimum load to prevent output voltage from climbing when no load is connected

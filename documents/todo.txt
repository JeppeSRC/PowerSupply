TODO for rev3:
	- Fan controller
*	- C_LIMIT and OUTPUT_ON LEDS to be driven by a nfet (2N7002NXAK) from VDD
*	- Increase output capacitance
	- Fix current sense amplifier oscillation
*	- Increase input capacitance
	- Make more room between encoders
*	- Additional push button for selecting boot loader during reset
*	- Connect Iread and Vread to SDADC and ADC
	- C_LIMIT controlled by hardware?
	- Fix Vset error amplifier output
*	- MOSFET that can be toggled to discharge caps when voltage changes
	- SMD based current shunt
